      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We believe the best automation isn't built by developers in isolation - it's designed by the people who understand the work. That's why we focus on empowering teams to identify and implement their own solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our workshops bridge the gap between "knowing AI exists" and "using AI effectively." We bring practical, hands-on training that gets your team running within hours, not weeks.
      </p>

      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Non-technical perspective:</strong> You don't need to be a developer to automate your work. We focus on tools and approaches that anyone can learn and maintain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Team-specific programs:</strong> Every team has different workflows, tools, and challenges. We design our training around your specific context for maximum relevance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem-solving based:</strong> We don't just teach concepts - we solve real problems during our sessions. You'll leave with working automations, not just theoretical knowledge.
      </p>

      <h2>Who We Work With</h2>
      <p>
        We work with companies of all sizes - from startups looking to build efficient processes from day one, to established teams wanting to modernize their workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our clients typically face one of two challenges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Process-heavy operations:</strong> Teams drowning in repetitive tasks like reporting, manual follow-ups, and data syncing.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical dependency:</strong> Automation requests stuck in developer backlogs while opportunities pass by.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If either sounds familiar, we should talk.
