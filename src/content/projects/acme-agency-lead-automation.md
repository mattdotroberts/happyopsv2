## The Problem

Acme Creative Agency was drowning in inbound leads but struggling to respond quickly. Their sales team spent hours each day manually reviewing form submissions, researching companies, and deciding which leads to prioritize.

High-quality leads were slipping through the cracks, and response times averaged 8-12 hours — far too slow in a competitive market.

## What We Built

We designed and implemented an end-to-end lead qualification system:

1. **Instant Lead Enrichment** — When a form is submitted, Claude AI researches the company and enriches the lead with firmographic data
2. **Smart Scoring** — Each lead is scored based on company size, industry fit, budget signals, and urgency indicators
3. **Intelligent Routing** — Hot leads are instantly routed to the right salesperson via Slack with a full brief
4. **CRM Automation** — All data flows into HubSpot with proper tagging and pipeline placement

## The Outcome

Within the first month:
- Response time dropped from 8 hours to under 5 minutes for qualified leads
- The sales team recovered 15+ hours per week previously spent on manual research
- Qualified lead conversion increased by 40% due to faster, more informed follow-ups

The system now handles 200+ leads per month on autopilot, with the team only touching the ones that matter.
