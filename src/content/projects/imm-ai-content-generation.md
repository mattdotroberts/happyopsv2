## The Problem

IMM is a digital advertising agency managing campaigns across multiple channels for diverse clients. Each campaign requires carefully crafted content that reflects the client's brand voice, product details, and strategic positioning.

Their creative team was spending 20+ hours per week manually adapting content across platforms — translating brand guidelines into ad copy, adjusting messaging for different audiences, and ensuring consistency across campaigns. This manual process was a bottleneck limiting how many clients they could serve effectively.

## What We Built

We designed and built a custom AI content generation platform that serves as IMM's creative co-pilot:

1. **Client Context Mapping** — A structured system to capture and organize each client's brand voice, product information, target audiences, and messaging guidelines
2. **Campaign Intelligence** — AI-powered content generation that understands advertising best practices across platforms (social, display, video scripts, landing pages)
3. **Multi-Channel Adaptation** — Automatic adaptation of core messaging into platform-specific formats while maintaining brand consistency
4. **Quality Control Pipeline** — Built-in review workflows ensuring human oversight on all generated content

The platform is built on Supabase for data management, Claude for intelligent content generation, and deployed on Vercel for reliable, fast access by the entire team.

## The Outcome

Within the first month of deployment:

- Content creation time dropped from 20+ hours to under 5 hours per week
- The team can now handle 3x more client campaigns without adding headcount
- Cost savings of approximately $10,000 per week in creative production time
- Faster turnaround means happier clients and more competitive pitches

The system now powers content generation across all of IMM's client accounts, freeing their creative team to focus on strategy and high-touch creative work rather than repetitive adaptation tasks.
