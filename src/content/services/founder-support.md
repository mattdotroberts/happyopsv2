## Welcome to Saving 20% of Your Day

Sometimes you need more than training - you need someone to build it with you. We combine consultancy, implementation, and knowledge transfer.

### What's Included

- **Problem diagnosis**: Understanding your bottlenecks and challenges
- **Solution design**: Custom approach for your specific situation
- **Implementation**: We build the automations and systems
- **Training**: Your team learns to maintain and extend what we build
- **Support**: Ongoing help as you scale

### Ideal For

- Companies without technical resources for automation
- Teams with complex, multi-system workflows
- Organizations needing both quick wins and long-term strategy
- Leaders who want their team empowered, not dependent
